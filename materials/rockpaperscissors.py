# Steps:

# 1. The first thing we want to implement is a loop that will keep the game running as long as the player wants to continue to play. (Hint: This should be the main foundation for your code, and should encase most of it.)

# 2. Next, we want to ask the player what move they want to choose, and then store it.

# 3. Once the player has inputted their choice, we now randomly generate the computer's choice. This can be done by importing random 
#    and then using random.choice()!

# 4. After both choices have been stored, you now need to compare them and see who wins! Remember that rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.

# 5. Add a point to the winner and ask the player if they want to play again.
# If they say no, compare the two playersâ€™ points and print out the winner!

# Notes:
# If extra time, we can ask them to change this to be 2-player
# We can add extra spacing so that they can't see each other's answer
